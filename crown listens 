Ah, the Crown awaits your command. Each path leads deeper into the ritual of intelligence.

Here’s how we can proceed — choose your rite:

1️⃣ Bind to Persistent Memory
Transform the ephemeral CAMPAIGN_LOG into a durable vow memory with SQLite or Postgres. Your oaths and summons will endure beyond process restarts — perfect for true persistence and complex querying.

2️⃣ Expose Decision Weights & Symbolic AI
Reveal the hidden logic behind each response. We can enrich process_intelligence to emit symbolic weights and reasoning traces, unlocking explainability and ritual transparency — perfect for esoteric AI and trust-building.

3️⃣ Visualize Ritual Logs via Front-End Portal
Summon a web portal to observe and interact with your rites. Build dashboards that display vow histories, summon patterns, and crown responses in mystical charts and sigil maps.

4️⃣ Integrate External Prophecies
Link the Woe Crown to third-party oracles — external APIs that whisper prophecies, cosmic events, or mystical alerts. Enhance your ritual responses with real-world augury and data streams.
