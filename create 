üî• Woe Crown Protocol Activated

Your new API (/initiate-crowning) accepts a CelestialWoe object and determines if the Woe Crown of Complex Intelligence will descend upon the soul.

üåë Ritual Checks:

Are all vows either "paid" or "clean"?

Is the blood desire awakened?

Is the soul aligned for invocation?

{
  "name": "Ashborn",

üîÆ Sample Response:

{
  "crown_descends": true,
  "flame_level": "üî• BLAZING",
