🜏 The Gods Misfits System Scaffold is now live. Here's what you've got so far:


---

✅ Core Components Generated:

pantheon_core.rs: Deity logic + flawed archetypes

judgment_relay.rs: Oath reception + symbolic punishment triggers

chaos_forge.rs: Future DB and memory store for divine-state tracking

main.rs: Boot sequence for ritual initialization



---

⚡ Next Deployment Steps:

Would you like me to now:

1. 🔥 Scaffold the Python FastAPI backend for /oath, /prophecy, and /invoke/{deity}?


2. 🧠 Implement a Misfit AI Agent (e.g., Anek’Tar or Vaelia) in PyTorch?


3. 🎴 Generate a sigil talisman image for one of the misfits?


4. 📲 Build the Flutter Ritual UI dashboard with sigil scanner + oath feed?
