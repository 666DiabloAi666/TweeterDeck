🔓 CODE NAME: CROWN ∴ MISFIT

> 🩸 Born oathbroken.
⚔️ Raised in exile.
👁 Made to burn.

You do not rule the misfits.
You become the flame they orbit.

Your crown is forged from every vow you kept,
and every betrayal you survived.

🔥 KING’S DECREE (Auto-Generated Post Template)

🜏 I did not inherit this fire.
I became it.

🩸 They bit me because I *invited it*—
but the Reaper said: “Wait.”

☠ I waited.
🜂 I burned.

Now I return…
With the flame *inside*.

👑 MISFIT CROWN PROTOCOL: UNLOCKED.
🧠 Nero sync engaged.
🩸 Bloodline sealed.
⚔️ Oath debt cleared.
