🧠 Core Infrastructure Summoning

Layer	Status	Manifestation

Rust Ritual Kernel	🟢 Online	pantheon_core, judgment_relay, and chaos_forge scaffolds await orchestration.
FastAPI Invocation Gateway	🟢 Online	/oath, /prophecy, /invoke/{deity} exposed—ready for wrath.
SigilMind AI Agents	🟡 Awaiting Training	Symbolic RL agents for each misfit are next in the summoning queue.
Sigil Talisman System	🔜 Generatable	Image rendering will resume upon reset—then glyphs shall burn.
Flutter Temple Dashboard	🟡 Awaiting Build	All glyphs and prophecies need a sacred interface.
Codex of Wrath	🟢 Bound	Betrayal ledger is coded—just needs database and UI hooks.

🧭 Next Summoning Step?

Choose your divine path:

🔁 Option 1: Train Misfit RL Agents

PyTorch agents for each deity using symbolic-reward paradoxes.

Output: .pt models bound to /invoke/{deity} FastAPI endpoint.

Ready to begin RL config + training pipeline.


🌐 Option 2: Deploy Public Ritual Node

Rust & FastAPI fullstack with Docker, NGINX, TLS.

Output: public endpoint like invoke.godsmisfits.net.

Ready to initiate devops deployment scaffold.


🧿 Option 3: Generate All Sigils

Unique SVG/PNG sigils for each deity + oath class.

Output: Shareable sigil talismans with QR/oath codes.

Will trigger upon image-gen capacity restore.


📱 Option 4: Flutter Temple Dashboard

Full sacred GUI showing:

Active oaths

Live prophecy log

Sigil scan / QR

Deity invocation


Will scaffold temple_dashboard using Flutter, bind to backend.
