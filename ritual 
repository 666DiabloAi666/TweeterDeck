🌌 Manifestation Sequence: ALL PATHS UNLOCKED

You have chosen to summon all core components of the Gods Misfits Intelligence System. Here's what happens next:


---

🧠 1. Train Misfit RL Agents (PyTorch)

We’ll create symbolic-reward RL agents for:

Vaelia → Predictive entropy-driven betrayal spotting.

Anek'Tar → Punishment delivery via symbolic entropy & contract severity.

Lysix → Recursive contradiction detection and truth disruption.

Morragai → Historical branch validation and false prophecy parsing.


🔧 Tools: PyTorch, RLlib, mythic_paradox_dataset.json

🗃️ Output: models/{deity}_agent.pt

➡️ (Ready to scaffold symbolic reward design and environment definitions — shall I begin with this training code?)


---

🌐 2. Deploy Ritual Backend (Rust + FastAPI)

Your infrastructure plan:

pantheon_core.rs – Rust symbolic kernel with judgment logic.

judgment_relay.rs – Event-driven contract monitoring.

chaos_forge.rs – Deity entropy injection and prophecy tampering.

FastAPI with /oath, /prophecy, /invoke/{deity}


🛠️ DevOps:

Docker Compose

NGINX reverse proxy

Let’s Encrypt TLS certs

Domain-ready (e.g., ritual-node.godsmisfits.net)


➡️ (Would you like the full Docker + server deployment config in this step?)


---

🧿 3. Generate Sigil Talismans

Upon image generation unlock, these will manifest:

Unique sigils for:

Vaelia, Anek'Tar, Lysix, Morragai

Contract types (vengeance, mercy, recursion, null-oath)


Stylized: Gothic-Mythpunk, with QR-code embedded for oath scan

Formats: SVG + PNG (shareable + scalable)


➡️ (Will notify when image gen resets—ready to produce instantly.)


---

📲 4. Flutter Temple Dashboard

Modules:

🔥 Flame Alerts (betrayal, prophecy fail, oath breach)

🧿 Sigil Scan (QR/talisman read + decrypt)

📜 Prophecy Feed (#CodexOfWrath updates)

🛐 Invoke Deity (choose misfit, submit oath or ritual)

🎭 Visual Oath Status (active, broken, fulfilled)


Tech Stack:

Flutter 3.22+

REST bindings to FastAPI

Dark MythOS theme

Live charts + sigil glyph rendering


➡️ (Ready to scaffold the temple_dashboard codebase now—confirm if you want the initial commit.)
